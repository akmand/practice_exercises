    "In line with the [SK1 Tutorial](https://www.featureranking.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/sk-part-1-basic-modeling/), the objective of this practice notebook is to familiarize you with working with a regression problem using a `holdout` approach. The dataset under consideration is the `diamonds` dataset that comes with the `ggplot2` library in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `diamonds` dataset contains information on diamonds including carat (numeric), clarity (categorical), cut (categorical), and color (categorical). The dataset has 10 features and 53940 instances. The objective is to predict the price of a diamond in USD given its attributes. "

    "0. Refer to our data prep practice solutions on Canvas as well as our data prep script on GitHub [here](https://github.com/akmand/datasets/blob/master/prepare_dataset_for_modeling.py) for some inspiration on preparing this data for predictive modeling.\n",
    "1. Set `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)`. Read in the raw data `diamonds.csv` on GitHub [here](https://github.com/akmand/datasets). Have a look at the shape and data types of the features. Also have a look at the top 5 rows.\n",
    "2. Generate descriptive statistics for categorical and numerical features separately.\n",
    "3. Have a look at the unique values for each categorical feature and check whether everything is OK in the sense that there are no unusual values.\n",
    "4. Make sure there are no missing values anywhere.\n",
    "5. Separate the last column from the dataset and set it to \"target\". Make sure \"target\" is a `Pandas` series at this point, and not a `NumPy` array (which will be necessary for the sampling below). Set all the other columns to be the \"Data\" data frame, which will be the set of descriptive features.\n",
    "6. Make sure all categorical descriptive features are encoded via one-hot-encoding. In this particular dataset, some categorical descriptive features are actually ordinal, but we will go ahead and encode them via one-hot-encoding for simplicity.\n",
    "7. Make sure all descriptive features are scaled via min-max scaling and the output is a `Pandas` data frame with correct column names. Do **NOT** scale the target feature!\n",
    "8. Finally have a look at the top 5 rows of \"target\" and \"Data\" respectively."
