    "\n",
    "As in the [SK4 Tutorial](https://www.featureranking.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/sk-part-4-cross-validation-and-hyperparameter-tuning/), the objective of this practice notebook is to illustrate how you can perform cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning using `Scikit-Learn`. You will also perform paired t-tests to determine statistically significant performance results, as explained [here](https://www.featureranking.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/sk-part-5-advanced-topics-pipelines-statistical-model-comparison-and-model-deployment/#4). \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using the cleaned \"income data\" dataset. In the previous practices, you cleaned and transformed the raw `income data` and renamed the `income` column as `target` (with high income being the positive class). Including `target`, the cleaned data consists of 42 columns and 45,222 rows. Each column is numeric and between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `GridSearchCV()`, try setting `n_jobs` to -2 for shorter run times with parallel processing. Here, -2 means use all core except 1. See [SK5 Tutorial](https://www.featureranking.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/sk-part-5-advanced-topics-pipelines-statistical-model-comparison-and-model-deployment/) for more details."

    "- For ease of computation, you will first randomly sample 5,000 rows from this dataset. \n",

    "- You will use the first set for **training**: you will fine tune your models using this train data. \n",
    "- You will use the second set for **testing**: you will perform cross-validation in a paired fashion using the test data and then you will compare the performance of your tuned models using a paired t-test.\n",
    "- You will use **stratified 5-fold cross-validation with no repetitions** during both training and testing.\n",

Second, we conduct a paired t-test for the AUC score between the following (tuned) classifier combinations.\n",
