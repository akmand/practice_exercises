    "As part of the [SK5 Tutorial](https://www.featureranking.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/sk-part-5-advanced-topics-pipelines-statistical-model-comparison-and-model-deployment/), the objective of this practice notebook is to illustrate how you can set up `pipelines` for streamlining your machine learning workflow using `Scikit-Learn`. Pipelines make life easier in relatively large machine learning projects by combining multiple steps in to a single process.\n",

    "You will be using the cleaned \"income data\" dataset. In the previous practices, you cleaned and transformed the raw `income data` and renamed the `income` column as `target` (with high income being the positive class). Including `target`, the cleaned data consists of 42 columns and 45,222 rows. Each column is numeric and between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use **stratified 5-fold cross-validation with no repetitions** during training. For testing, you will use the fine-tuned model for prediction **without** any cross-validation for simplicity.\n",

    "In `GridSearchCV()`, try setting `n_jobs` to -2 for shorter run times with parallel processing. Here, -2 means use all core except 1."
